There are 28 headers:
1. interp: its Readonly
  - This holds the path name of a program interpreter. 
  - If the file has a loadable segment that includes relocation, the sections' attributes will include the SHF_ALLOC bit; otherwise, that bit will be off, i.e., 0.
2. note.gnu.property:- it holds all the GNU properties.
3. note.gnu.build-id: - it holds all the GNU properties id.
4. note.ABI-tag :- declare the expected run-time ABI of the ELF image. It may include the operating system name and its run-time versions
5. gnu.hash: - to store gnu hash config informations
6. dynsym: - This section holds the dynamic linking symbol table
7. dynstr: - This section holds strings needed for dynamic linking, most commonly the strings that represent the names associated with symbol table entries.
8. gnu.version: -This section contains the Symbol Version Table.
9. gnu.version_r : -This section contains the Version Requirments.
10. rela.dyn: - This section holds RELA type relocation information for all sections of a shared library except the PLT
11. rela.plt: - This section holds RELA type relocation information for the PLT section of a shared library or dynamically linked application
12. init: - This section holds executable instructions that contribute to the process initialization code. When a program starts to run, the system arranges to execute the code in this section before calling the main program entry point (called main for C programs)
13. plt (Procedure Linkage Table): - trigger the code in the linker to look up the address
14. plt.got :- Stores the addresses for plt
15. text:- This section holds the `text,' or executable instructions, of a program.
16. fini:- This section holds executable instructions that contribute to the process termination code
17. rodata: - This section holds read-only data that typically contribute to a non-writable segment in the process image.
18. eh_frame_hdr: - This section contains information necessary for frame unwinding during exception handling
19. eh_frame:- This section contains information necessary for frame unwinding during exception handling
20. tbss:- special section to hold uninitialized thread-local data that contribute to the program's memory image
21. init_array:- This section holds an array of function pointers that contributes to a single initialization array for the executable or shared object containing the section.
22. fini_array: -This section holds an array of function pointers that contributes to a single termination array for the executable or shared object containing the section.
23. data.rel.ro: - This section holds initialized data that contribute to the program's memory image.
24. dynamic: - This section holds dynamic linking information.
25. got: - (Global Offset Table) section of computer program's memory used to enable computer program code compiled as an ELF file to run correctly,
26. got.plt: - Stores the addresses for plt
27. data: - This section holds initialized data that contribute to the program's memory image.
28. bss: - This section holds uninitialized data that contribute to the program's memory image.
29. comment: - This section holds version control information.

### Step 2: Getting the list of Shared library dependencies.

> linux-vdso.so.1: It's a virtual shared object that doesn't have any physical file on the disk; it's a part of the kernel that's exported into every program's address space when it's loaded.
> libm.so.6: this library is used for performing mathematical functions
> libcrypto.so.3: The libcrypto library provides the fundamental cryptographic routines used by libssl.
> libc.so.6: this library is for calling standard functions that can be used by all C programs
> /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2: Itâ€™s a dynamic linker, used to run dynamically-linked programs.
