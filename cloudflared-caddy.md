# Cloudflared Caddy to launch website without a Public IP Address

### Requirements:
1. Docker
2. Caddy -  web server
3. Cloudflared docker container: to create the tunnel

### Setup
- Two Docker containers : 1 hosting the website and another hosting cloudflared.
- One Docker network: So cloudflare tunnel can host the website.

#### before that WHY CADDY?
##### Pros:
  - Extremely easy to set up with automatic HTTPS via Let's Encrypt.
  - The configuration is done through a simple file.
  - Written in Go, making it quite performant and low on resource usage.
##### Cons:
  - Less mature and has a smaller community than Nginx or Apache.
  - The simplicity of configuration might limit complex setups.

### The Setup:
1. Caddyfile:
```
hostname {
  root * /usr/share/caddy
  file_server
}
```
2. Dockerfile
```
# Start from the Alpine base image
FROM alpine:latest

# Install Caddy
RUN apk add --no-cache caddy

# Copy the Caddyfile and site contents into the container
COPY Caddyfile /etc/caddy/Caddyfile
COPY /path/to/your/site /usr/share/caddy

# Expose the HTTP port
EXPOSE 80

# Set the working directory
WORKDIR /usr/share/caddy

# Start Caddy
CMD ["caddy", "file-server", "--root", "/usr/share/caddy"]
```
